        <h1>Best Movies According to Gracie</h1>
        <h2>The top movies I have seen in 2023</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>The Legend Of Vox Machina</h3>
        <p>I loved this because it started out as very regular but ended up being so indepth and thought provoking</p>
        <p>It has one of my favourite movie quote delivery from a villain and it reads:</p>
        <p>
            People of Emon<br />
            Thordak demands capitulation<br />
            Submit to the Cindar King<br />
            <br />
            [Fight Interlude]<br />
            <br />
            Your monuments shall fall<br />
            Your civilization erased<br />
            <br />
            Hear me insects<br />
            You live out of mercy<br />
            Fight or flee and you forfeit that mercy<br />
            A new age is upon you<br />
            The rule of the Chroma Conclave<br />
            [Roar]<br />

        </p>    
        
        

        <h3>Fear The Night</h3>
        <p>For me, this was a girlpower movie done very well. Continuity was very good and the acting was very convincing as well</p>

        <h3>One Piece</h3>
        <p>This is still an ongoing journey but it remain wonderful at every inch</p>

        <h3>Murder mystery 2</h3>
        <p>Laidback, fun, hilarious and definitely better than the first one</p>

        <h3>Hell's Paradise</h3>
        <p>Excellent visuals, interesting storyline and almost unpredictable series of events</p>

        <h3>Demon Slayer - Entertainment district arc</h3>
        <p>Super duper duper visuals, breathtaking animation, rich fight scenes and very climatic ending</p>
